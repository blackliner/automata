# monorepo automata

This is my monorepo, where I try out all different kinds of stuff:
* TDD
* selfmade neural network with back propagation learning
* autonomous automata with graphics
* bazel
  * basics like defining external dependencies and make them available inside the project (gtest, Catch2 etc.)
  * building external cmake project with `rules_foreign_cc`
  * installing with `bazel_rules_install`
* SFML
* automated coverage reports from unittests
* docker
* various other stuff
